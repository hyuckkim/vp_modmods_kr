(7a) VP Events Overhaul (Expansion Pack system) changelog:

v2.0 (08/09/2024)
-- Added EP-8 Corporation Events
-- Set Event and CityEvent databases to clear when mod fires (to remove base VP events)
-- Added Hokath Civilization Events from Community Events mod (temporary until adjustment) and blocked Community Events mod


-- Added audio and art files from Community Events mod
-- Set Religious Relics and Notorious Pirate city events to only fire for one city at a time. Was seeing it way too often.
-- Corrected text errors on Guild Sponsorship event (under City Specialization)
-- Took expiration timer off of Harbor Trade city event.
-- Reduced chance for Voices city event. Was seeing it way too often.
-- Reduced chance for AA Mineglint city event. Was seeing it way too often.
-- Increased chance for farm floods. Rarely saw it, and seemed like it should be a more common natural disaster.

-- BROKEN FOR NOW - LOOKING FOR A FIX --
-- LUA error causing religious events not to fire - My belief is that the dummy policy is not being created
-- Hide unavailable Religion and NW events behind new disabled text

v2.1 (08/09/2024)
-- Corrected database errors in Religious Events
