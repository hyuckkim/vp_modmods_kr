		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_PLAYER_EVENT_POLLUTION_HELP">
			<Text>With the shift in our economy towards larger scale manufacturing, energy-intenstive industries are springing up everywhere. With little regulation and unrestrained growth, the very air we breathe and water we drink is becoming unfit for use. Our waterways are toxic channels, full of slime and dead fish. The smell of smoke is constantly in the air, and the stain of soot is all over our buildings and clothes. We must rein in these industrialists, or the consequences could be dire.[NEWLINE]</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_PLAYER_EVENT_POLLUTION_CHOICE_1">
			<Text>Dead fish and unbreathable air? I even hear that one of our rivers even caught on fire and burned for days! Have our Science Advisor and Economic Advisor work together to come up with some kind of rules to govern these industries.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_PLAYER_EVENT_POLLUTION_CLEANUP1_CHOICE_1_HELP">
			<Text>[NEWLINE]As a result of these regulations, [ICON_PRODUCTION] Production in all of our Cities is reduced by 5%. But, if you look out the window, you can see the air is just a little bit clearer...and the water doesn't taste quite so bad.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_PLAYER_EVENT_POLLUTION_CLEANUP2_CHOICE_1">
			<Text>It seems like we don't have much of a choice. Let's pass some kind of legislation to protect our future.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_PLAYER_EVENT_POLLUTION_CLEANUP2_CHOICE_1_HELP">
			<Text>[NEWLINE]As a result of this new legislation, [ICON_PRODUCTION] Production in all of our Cities is reduced by 5%. Hopefully, if given enough time, our citizens will be able to step outside without their lungs burning and eyes watering.</Text>
