SELECT  'Hereditary Rule is a form of government wherein the rulership is passed down from one member of the family to the next. There is often a religious justification for hereditary rule; kings are said to rule by "divine right" or "the mandate of Heaven." The strength of hereditary rule is that there is usually a clear line of succession, and thus perhaps less squabbling for power when the current monarch dies. However, hereditary rule suffers the same kind of weaknesses as do all unelected rulers: the leader is not answerable to the people, and it can be extremely difficult to get rid of a bad one.',

The advantage of slavery is that it allows people to be forced to do jobs that they would otherwise refuse to do without adequate compensation. Cheap labor results in concentration of wealth and thus the creation of great buildings and temples or the maintenance of large professional armies.
