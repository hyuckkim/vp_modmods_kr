<!--
num_tiles:
  This specifies how many tile textures there are to load. For example, if this value was
  3 then the game will try to load "forest_tile1.dds", "forest_tile2.dds" and "forest_tile3.dds"
  
random_trees_per_tile:
  -Number of trees to place randomly in the tiles
  -Must be a multiple of 200
  
gridded_trees_per_tile:
  -Number of trees to place in a jittered grid inside the tiles. If a gridded tree is outside
  of valid tile area, it will be placed randomly inside the valid tile.
  -Must be a multiple of 200
  
 overlay_alpha:
  -Alpha multiplier for the terrain overlay on trees. Setting this to 0 would not show the
  overlay while 1 would show it at full brightness.
  
  space_between
  -Minimimum space between trees. This allows us to create a rough poisson distribution
  This is for a tree of size 1, smaller trees will get coorrispondingly less space, setting too big
  might cause an infinite loop!
