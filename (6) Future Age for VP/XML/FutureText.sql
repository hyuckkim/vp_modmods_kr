The Prometheus Space Program is a key institution that represents humanity's instinct to explore space. This plan is the fruit of mankind's dream of interstellar travel to our solar system's closest star, Alpha Centauri. To realize that goal, the Prometheus program is leading humanity's advance into space by conducting activities in various fields such as research, technology development, and spacecraft manufacturing. The background of this birth began with the space race that began in the mid-20th century. During this time, each country devoted its energy to space research to show off its national power and secure technological prowess. And as a result of this research, we have developed technologies to send humans to the moon, explore Mars, and send spacecraft to the nearest star, Alpha Centauri. However, these technologies are not purely scientific. Expanding our living space has become an important goal due to various problems on the planet, such as climate change, resource scarcity, and overpopulation. The Prometheus space program is an important step toward realizing this goal, leading humanity's foray into space. Today, it plays an important role in researching the possibilities of interstellar travel, developing the technology needed to expand humanity's space presence, and preparing for the first interstellar journey to Alpha Centauri. These efforts will expand our knowledge, explore new possibilities, and eventually enable humanity to enter space."
